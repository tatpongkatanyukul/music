## What Is Tension in Music?
Tension in music production is the anticipating build up of rhythm, harmony, melody, and dynamics. When songwriters or composers build up tension in a song, they create a feeling of unrest or expectation, which can develop an emotional experience for the listener.

## What Is Release in Music?
The release in a music track comes when enough tension has built up, creating a relaxing or satisfying feeling for the listener. When you release tension in music, you provide a resolution for the piece of music, which allows the song to recreate tension once again, moving the song forward.

## How to Create Tension and Release in Music
Tension and release occur in every song, even the most relaxing or soothing ones. Notes in a composition build to moments that create feelings and expectations for listeners, eventually leading to release, which is the change that occurs to finally break the tension. You can create tension and release in music in the following ways:

  1. Repetition. Repeating the same bundle of chords or notes creates rhythmic tension by establishing a predictable pattern and putting emphasis on these sounds. Depending on the style of music, a sudden chord change that breaks up the repetition can either produce a satisfying release for the build up, or create more tension by pulling the listener out of their audio comfort zone.

  2. Dissonance. Create harmonic tension by putting two notes together that feel unstable or uneasy (like a middle C and its neighboring semitone, C-sharp). Dissonant note pairings are often used in horror films or video games, and even in comedy productions to escalate tension and produce excitement. The listener wants reconciliation for the notes, which feeds into the anticipation of where the music is going. Release comes when the notes once again achieve consonance or harmony.
  
  3. Key changes. When a song shifts between keys, it creates anticipation to return to its resolutive tone, the original tonic chord, which serves as the tonal center for a composition. Adding minor keys or moving out of the familiar note zone can also contribute to musical tension, where the listener feels uneasy until the music returns to its initial sound. 
  
  4. Dynamics. Music that increases in pitch or loudness builds toward a climax for the listener. Music can get louder gradually or suddenly, and each way delivers its own unique feeling of tension. The chord progression eventually has to reach a crescendo and fall again, which is how the song—and thus, the listener—achieves release. Silence is also a part of music’s dynamicness.
  
  5. Restriction. Some music, like EDM, relies on building tension by holding off longer to release. An exciting build up of a rhythmic pattern leads to a climactic moment (also known as “the drop”), where reaching the peak of the music achieves release.
